# Hello, I'm Braden Byrnes

I am a student currently learning about cybersecurity. Previously I was a programmer for a robotics team in the FRC robotics competition, I have experience programming in Python and Java, and always looking for ways to improve.

## Previous projects

[4598 Rapid React]([GitHub - AltaHighRobotics/4598RapidReact](https://github.com/AltaHighRobotics/4598RapidReact)) In this project I helped program a competition robot in Java, my most notable contribution was functionality to allow the robot to climb monkey bars.

[FRC Utilities]([GitHub - AltaHighRobotics/FRC-Utilities](https://github.com/AltaHighRobotics/FRC-Utilities)) In this project I helped create a library to help future programmers more easily make autonomous functions for their robots.

## Currently Learning

I'm always looking for ways to improve my current skill set, here's what I'm working on right now

[The C programming language]([GitHub - Pufferfish3000/C-Server](https://github.com/Pufferfish3000/C-Server)) Currently I'm learning the C programming language, in this repository I practice C fundamentals as well as basic networking.

[Networking and Sockets]([GitHub - Pufferfish3000/PythonScanner](https://github.com/Pufferfish3000/PythonScanner)) Im also learning about implementing networking in programming, in this example I created a simple network scanner in a language I'm more familiar with
